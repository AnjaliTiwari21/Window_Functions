--Refresher on Aggregates
1. We would like to find the total weight of cats grouped by age. But only return those groups with a total weight larger than 12.
select age, sum(weight) as total_weight
from cats 
group by age
having sum(weight)>12
order by age


-- Running Totals (known as Cumulative Totals)
2. Question: The cats must be ordered by name and will enter an elevator one by one. We would like to know what the running total weight is.
SELECT name, SUM(weight) OVER (order by name) AS running_total_weight
FROM cats
