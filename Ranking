Ranking can add an ordered number to each of your output rows.The commands used are: rank, row_number, dense_rank, cume_dist, percent_rank

-- Unique Numbers
Question:
The cats form a line grouped by color. Inside each color group the cats order themselves by name. 
Every cat must have a unique number for its place in the line.
We must assign each cat a unique number while maintaining their color & name ordering.

SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY color, name) AS unique_number, name, color 
FROM cats 

-- Ordering
Question: We would like to find the fattest cat. Order all our cats by weight.
The two heaviest cats should both be 1st. The next heaviest should be 3rd.

SELECT RANK() OVER (ORDER BY weight DESC), weight, name 
FROM cats 
ORDER BY rank, name

-- Further Ordering
For cats age means seniority, we would like to rank the cats by age (oldest first).
However we would like their ranking to be sequentially increasing.

SELECT DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY age DESC) as dense_rank, name, age
FROM cats
ORDER BY dense_rank, name

--Percentages
percent_rank()
cume_dist()
